00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.860
Loving can hurt.

2
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.580
Loving can hurt sometimes.

3
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.790
But it's the only thing that I know

4
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.190
when I kiss hard.

5
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.280
You know, it can get hard sometimes.

6
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.460
It is the only thing that makes us feel
alive.

7
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.810
We keep this loving photograph.

8
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.760
We made these memories for ourselves where
our eyes are never

9
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.370
closing. Hearts are never broken.

10
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.020
Time's forever frozen.

11
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.710
So you can.

12
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.540
Keep me.

13
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.240
Inside the pocket of your.

14
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.380
James. Hold me closer till our eyes, mate.

15
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.080
You won't ever be alone.

16
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.880
Wait for me to come home.

17
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.050
Loving can heal.

18
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.060
Your loving kin man just saw.

19
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.630
And it's the only.

20
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.060
Thing that I know.

21
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.980
No.

22
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.370
I swear it will get easier.

23
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.050
Remember that with every piece of the.

24
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.980
And then it's the only thing we.

25
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.950
Take with us when we die.

26
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.500
Mhm. We keep this love in this photograph.

27
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.500
We made these memories for ourselves where
our eyes were never caught.

28
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.840
The hearts will never be broken.

29
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.310
And time's forever frozen stare.

30
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.790
So you can keep.

31
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.900
Inside the pocket of your.

32
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.670
Gene holding me closer to.

33
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.240
I mean, they won't.

34
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.650
Ever be alone.

35
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.060
And if you hurt me, That's okay, baby.

36
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.250
On your words, bleep.

37
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.890
Inside these pages, you just.

38
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.850
To me and I don't.

39
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.060
Let you go.

40
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.200
Wait for me to come home.

41
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.820
Wait for me to come home.

42
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.360
Wait for me to come.

43
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.790
Wait for me to come.

44
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.770
Me inside the.

45
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.210
Necklace you got.

46
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.400
When you were sick.

47
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.210
Be.

48
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.070
I will remember how you kissed.

49
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.950
Me under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
here.

50
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.410
And you whisper through.

51
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.580
Wait for me to come home.

52
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.740
The necklace.

53
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.430
You got.

54
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.750
When you were six.

55
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.420
Be.

56
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.120
Inside this.
