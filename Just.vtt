00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.660
Oh, her eyes.

2
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.190
Her eyes make the stars look like they're
not shining her hair.

3
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.640
Her hair falls perfectly without her trying.

4
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.520
She's so beautiful.

5
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.490
And I tell her every day.

6
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.900
Yeah, I know.

7
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.500
I know. When I compliment her, she won't
believe me.

8
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.110
It's so. It's so sad to think that she don't
see what I seen.

9
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.800
But every time she asked me, do I look okay?

10
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.250
I say.

11
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.160
When I see your face.

12
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.830
There's not a thing.

13
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.560
I would change because you're lazy.

14
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.690
Just the way you are.

15
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.530
And when you smile.

16
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.550
The whole world stops and stands for.

17
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.300
Because carryover may.

18
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.220
Her lips. Her lips.

19
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.980
I could kiss them all day if she led me.

20
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.370
Her laugh. Her laugh she hates.

21
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.420
But I think it's so sexy.

22
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.270
She's so beautiful.

23
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.660
And I tell her every day.

24
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.880
Oh, you know, you.

25
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.670
You know, I'd never ask you to change.

26
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.640
If perfect's what you're searching for, then
just stay the same.

27
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.370
So don't even bother asking if you look
okay.

28
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.290
You know, I'll say.

29
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.410
Hey, when I see your face.

30
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.030
There's not a thing that I.

31
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.920
Change because you're.

32
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.580
A. Using just the way you are.

33
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.370
And when you smile.

34
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.920
Just the way you are.

35
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.200
Got.

36
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.020
You.

37
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.410
Is.

38
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.620
It's not a thing.

39
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.280
I would change because you're remain.

40
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.670
And just the way you are.

41
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.890
And when you smile.

42
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.980
The whole world stops and stares.

43
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.350
I'll just go.

44
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.360
You're amazing.

45
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.710
And just. You are.
