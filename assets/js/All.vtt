00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.360
What would I do without your smart mouth
drawing

2
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.900
me in and you kicking me out?

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.320
You've got my head spinning.

4
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.090
No kidding.

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.610
I can't pin you down.

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.690
What's going on in that Beautiful Mind.

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.170
I'm on your magical mystery ride.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.430
And I'm so dizzy.

9
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.270
Don't know what hit me, but I'll be all
right.

10
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.870
My head's under.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.740
I'm breeding five.

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.610
You're crazy.

13
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.710
And I'm out of my mind.

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.540
Cause all of me loves

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.410
all. You love your cousin.

16
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.220
All your edges on your perfect
imperfections.

17
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.980
Give your.

18
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.480
To me.

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.790
I'll give my.

20
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.620
And you. You're my.

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.780
And in my beginning.

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.190
Even when I.

23
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.270
I'm winning because I'll give you a.

24
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.830
For me. And you give me a.

25
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.080
You.

26
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.780
How many times do I have to tell you?

27
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.810
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful
to.

28
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.440
The world is beating you down.

29
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.160
And I'm around through every mood.

30
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.550
You're my downfall.

31
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.030
You're my muse.

32
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.900
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
can't

33
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.480
stop singing.

34
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.680
It's ringing in my head From

35
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.360
you. My hands know.

36
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.060
But I'm breathing fire.

37
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.980
You're crazy and out of my

38
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.480
mind because all of me

39
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.790
learns all.

40
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.580
Love your cousin, all your edges on your
perfect

41
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.390
imperfections. So give your.

42
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.690
All to me.

43
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.590
I'll give my all.

44
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.900
See you.

45
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.990
You're my.

46
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.800
And in my beginning, even when I

47
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.970
lose, I'm winning because I give you all.

48
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.180
And you give me a.

49
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.780
You give me?

50
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.060
All of you.

51
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.840
Cards on the table.

52
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.290
We're both showing.

53
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.560
Hearts risking in all.

54
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.240
Though. It's hard.

55
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.750
Because all of me loves

56
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.640
all of you love your curves and

57
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.480
all your edges on your perfect
imperfections.

58
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.580
Give your all to me.

59
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.420
I'll give it my all to you.

60
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.110
You're my hand in my beginning.

61
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.810
Even when I lose, I'm winning because I give
you all.

62
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.020
Me. And you give me a.

63
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.690
For. You.

64
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.720
And I give you a.

65
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.390
And you give me a.

66
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.610
You owe.

67
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.290
And you give me.

68
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.650
You. Give me all of you.

69
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.000
Cards on the table.

70
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.550
We're both showing cards

71
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.640
risking. Though.

72
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.330
It's hard.
