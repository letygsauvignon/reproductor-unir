00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.230
When your legs don't work like they used to
before.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.500
And I can't sweep you off of your feet.

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.030
Well, you might still remember the taste of
my love.

4
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.210
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

5
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.770
And, darling, I.

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.820
Will be loving you till we're

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.470
70.

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.780
And baby. My.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.260
Hot stuff.

10
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.710
All ass hot at 23.

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.920
And I'm thinking about how people fall in
love in

12
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.920
mysterious ways.

13
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.990
Maybe just the touch of a hand.

14
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.780
Me. I fall in love with you every single
day.

15
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.310
And I just want to tell you, I.

16
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.580
Honey now.

17
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.730
Take me to your loving arms.

18
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.170
Kiss me.

19
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.060
Of a thousand suns.

20
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.500
Place your head on my beating heart.

21
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.150
I'm thinking out loud that maybe we find

22
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.810
love right where we are.

23
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.090
When my hair's all gone in, my memory fades.

24
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.440
And the crowds don't remember my name.

25
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.850
When my hands don't play the strings the
same way

26
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.530
I know you will still love me the same.

27
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.830
Because, honey, your soul can never grow

28
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.560
all It's evergreen.

29
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.700
Baby all smiles forever in my

30
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.070
mind and memory.

31
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.780
I'm thinking about how people fall in love
in

32
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.870
mysterious ways.

33
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.150
Maybe it's all part of the plan.

34
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.060
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes,
hoping

35
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.810
that.

36
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.670
You'll understand.

37
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.240
The baby now.

38
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.570
Take me into your loving arms.

39
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.090
Kiss me. Light of a thousand suns.

40
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.530
Place your head on my beating heart.

41
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.830
Thinking out loud.

42
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.760
Maybe we found a love, right when we.

43
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.180
Hello. La, la.

44
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.890
La la la.

45
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.770
So, baby, now.

46
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.770
Take me to your loving arms.

47
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.130
Kiss me Under the light of a thousand sighs.

48
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.210
Oh, darling.

49
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.470
Place your head.

50
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.450
On my beating heart.

51
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.730
I'm thinking. Oh, love.

52
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.270
And maybe we found love, right?

53
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.660
We are.

54
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.250
And maybe we.

55
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.570
Well, maybe we found love.

56
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.470
Right.

57
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.830
When we.

58
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.110
Take me into your loving arms.

59
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.630
Kiss me. Of a thousand suns.

60
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.010
Place your head on my beating heart.

61
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.390
Thinking out loud.

62
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.010
Maybe we found a love.
